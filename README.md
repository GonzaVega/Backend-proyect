Hello! thank you for taking a moment to see my project.

This a Rails 7.x project. Here you can create, edit or destroy conferences. Also you can do the same with users and add them to the conferences as speakers or as attendees. You can add one speaker and multiple attendees.

According to your needs, you can remove or add attendees to a conference, but first, you have to register in the database the user you want to add.

Also, this project includes bootstrap for styling and routes has been given HTTP status regarding of its action.

I'll thank any comments in this project to improve it.
